🚀 Argo CD on GKE with Helm - Standalone Project
This project demonstrates how to set up Argo CD on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster using Helm in a standalone configuration. This setup provides a complete GitOps solution for continuous deployment of applications.

🔹 What is GitOps?

GitOps is a modern way of implementing Continuous Deployment (CD) for cloud-native applications.
It uses Git as the single source of truth to deliver both applications and infrastructure.

In GitOps:

1.All configuration and deployment manifests are stored in Git.

2.Argo CD continuously monitors Git repositories.

3.Any change in Git is automatically synced and applied to the Kubernetes cluster.

This ensures deployments are declarative, version-controlled, and auditable.

🔹 What is Standalone Argo CD?
In a standalone setup, Argo CD operates as an independent deployment management system where:

1.Argo CD runs in its own dedicated namespace
2.Applications are managed through individual Application manifests
3.Each application can have its own Git repository source
4.Provides maximum flexibility for application deployment strategies

📋 Prerequisites

i.A GCP Project (with billing enabled)

ii.GKE Cluster created and running

iii.Google Cloud SDK (Cloud Shell is recommended)

iv.Helm installed

⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Connect to GKE Cluster
```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials argocd-cluster \
  --zone us-central1-a \
  --project modern-media-471511-c9
```

2. Add Argo Helm Repo
```
helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
```

3. Create Argo CD Namespace
```
kubectl create namespace argocd
```
4. Install Argo CD via Helm
```
helm install my-argo-cd argo/argo-cd \
  --version 8.3.5 \
  --namespace argocd
```

5. Expose Argo CD Server

Edit the Argo CD service to use a LoadBalancer:

```
kubectl edit svc argocd-server -n argocd
```

Find:
```
type: ClusterIP
```

Change it to:
```
type: LoadBalancer
```
6. Verify Deployment

Check if Argo CD pods are running:
```
kubectl get pods -n argocd
```

Check cluster nodes:
```
kubectl get nodes
```
7. Deploy an Application

Apply your application YAML file:

```
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adityaghatiya/argo-cd-projects/main/staldlone/argocd-files/application1.yaml
```

8. Access the Argo CD Dashboard

🔹 Get the external IP:
```
kubectl get svc argocd-server -n argocd
```
```
Example output:

NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)
argocd-server   LoadBalancer   10.96.128.34   34.118.230.45   80:31111/TCP,443:31802/TCP
```

🔹 Open in browser:
```
https://<EXTERNAL-IP>
```

9. Login to Argo CD

Username: admin

Password:
```
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret \
  -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d; echo
```

Use these credentials to log in to the dashboard.

10. Application in Argo CD Dashboard

The application is created inside the Argo CD dashboard from the GitHub YAML file:

🔹 Testing and Resyncing Applications

After deploying your application via Argo CD, you can verify that the GitOps workflow is working correctly by making changes in your Git repository and observing the automatic sync.

1. Make a change in your application

For example, update the replicas in standalone/app/helloworld/values.yaml:
```
replicaCount: 3
``
Commit and push the change to your Git repository

When opening the application, the required CD deployment is visible:
